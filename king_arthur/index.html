  <p>Hi Cindy and Aime,</p>
  <p>My name is Greg. I'm a Marketing Associate with an MBA. I've been waiting for the right opportunity to come up at the King Arthur  Flour Company and I think I found it. Here are:</p>
  <h1>7 reasons why I'd be a great Email Marketing Specialist:</h1>
</header>
<main>
<article class="post">
  
  <h2>#1: I stay up-to-date with marketing trends.</h2>
  <p>With all the <a href="http://blog.hubspot.com/marketing/optimize-emails-for-gmail-promotions-tab-ht" target="_blank">big</a> <a href="http://visual.ly/email-marketing-changing-%E2%80%93-rise-mobile-and-triggered-emails" target="_blank">changes</a> happening in email marketing, it's imperative for organizations to keep up with trends. I regularly read blogs like <a href="http://www.campaignmonitor.com/blog/" target="_blank">Campaign Monitor</a>, <a href="https://litmus.com/blog/" target="_blank">Litmus</a>, and <a href="http://www.emaildesignreview.com/">Email Design Review</a>, along with a host of other tech and marketing blogs. I believe my interest in the subject is something that can't be taught, and would be valuable to a company like King Arthur.</p>
  
  <h2>#2: I'm a self-starter with a passion for technology.</h2>
  <p>Technology has been an interest of mine for as long as I can remember. In fact, over the last few months I've been teaching myself the programming language <a href="https://www.ruby-lang.org/en/" target="_blank">Ruby</a> in my spare time (if you're not familiar with <a href="https://www.ruby-lang.org/en/" target="_blank">Ruby</a>, it's an elegant and powerful scripting language that is great for writing web applications). If you'd like, please feel free to check out my <a href="http://gregelizondo.github.io/" target="_blank">learning journal</a>.</p>
  <p>The prospect of bridging the gap between web and marketing teams sounds like a blast to me! It's where my two biggest professional passions collide.</p>
  
  <h2>#3: I've developed email marketing programs from the ground up.</h2>
  <p>In order to learn more about the sales and marketing process, I've been developing a downloadable education product, that teaches GRE-level math. I've been able to:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>create a predictable source of leads (one video of mine is in the #2 spot on YouTube for the search term "GRE Math") that drives daily email subscribers.</li>
    <li>write email marketing copy that converts.</li>
    <li>track analytics and tighten up my conversion funnel.</li>
    <li>develop a product comprised of video and written materials.</li>
    <li>provide great customer service and gather testimonials.</li>
  </ul>
  
  <p>The process has taught me a lot about creating great content, nurturing relationships, and learning from KPIs. </p>
  
  <h2>#4: I earned an MBA from Antioch University New England in <em>Organizational and Environmental Sustainability</em>.</h2>
  <p>While I was at Antioch, a large portion of my education was focused on developing marketing skills. Some of my favorite projects included a consulting job with the <a href="http://www.badgerbalm.com/" target="_blank">W.S. Badger Company</a>, and developing an actionable marketing guide, targeted at the restaurant industry.</p>
  <p>I specifically chose the program at Antioch because of its focus on triple bottom line business. I believe my personal values and those of King Arthur's are in alignment, which can be the basis of a great relationship.</p>
  
  <h2>#5: I regularly use HTML/CSS.</h2>
  <p>As a Marketing Associate at a small marketing firm, I wear many hats. Prior to me working there, all of the web development was outsourced to a different company. Since I've been there, we've been able to keep the majority of our web development in-house. Because of this, we've been able to increase the value we deliver to our customers.</p>
    
  <p>Here are a couple samples of sites I've worked on:</p>
  <a href="http://peterharriscreative.com/" target="_blank" class="no-bottom"><img src="images/phc_screenshot.png" alt="Peter Harris Creative website screenshot" /></a><a href="http://heartcenteredandprofitable.com/" target="_blank" class="no-bottom"><img src="images/hcp_screenshot.png" alt ="Heart Centered and Profitable screenshot" /></a>
  <p>By the way, you probably noticed the incentivized lead-capture at the top of both these sites. Building a strong email list is something I've pushed for with a lot of the clients we've worked with.</p>
  
  <h2>#6: I'm comfortable with a wide-range of software.</h2>
  <p>Admittedly, I haven't used Dreamweaver or Fireworks much. However, I am very comfortable with Illustrator, Photoshop, InDesign, and lots of other software. More importantly, I've been told that I pick up new software very quickly. I also regularly monitor Google Analytics for a number of different sites.</p>
  
  <h2>#7: People seem to like working with me.</h2>
  <p>A former professor and a current Regional Director with the <a href="http://www.nhsbdc.org/" target="_blank">NHSBDC</a> had this to say about me:</p>
  <blockquote>I am in a unique position of having worked with Greg while at Antioch and in his current position, and of his suite of impressive skills, I am most impressed with his ability to continually adapt to market conditions and the needs of his clients. Being a marketing professional today is not easy - one can no longer rely on "tried and true" methods, and Greg continues to embrace innovative approaches, especially those that build from technology platforms.</blockquote>
  
  <p>In addition to that, my current boss wrote about me:</p>
  <blockquote>Smart. Industrious. Innovative. Greg is pleasant to work with. He has well defined ideas and communicates them effectively. He has diverse interests and capabilities, which make him a tremendous asset in a small office. Greg is a great listener and a true collaborator.</blockquote>

  <h2>#8: I believe in over-delivering</h2>
  <p>There's no question that we live in a world that has grown tired of being marketed <em>to</em>. In order to thrive as a company today, I believe it's critical to constantly be over-delivering. It really seems like King Arthur is doing an amazing job of creating high-quality content and over-delivering at every chance they get. That sounds like the kind of company I'd like to work for.</p>
  
  <h2>Closing</h2>
  <p>If possible, I'd love to visit King Arthur for the chance to interview. My contact information is below.</p>
  
  <p>Cindy, if I don't hear back from you, I will be following up via email later this week. Here is a copy of my <a href="gelizondo_resume_ka.pdf">résumé</a></p>
  
  <p>I look forward to hearing from you. Thanks for your time.</p>
