	  <h2>My name is Greg</h2>
	  <p>I came across this <a href="https://weworkremotely.com/jobs/365" target="_blank">job posting on the WeWorkRemotely.com job board</a>. I love effective software, passionate companies, and solving problems.</p>
    <p>After reading Justine's testimonial and watching the <a href="https://litmus.com/meet-the-team" target="_blank">behind the scenes video</a>, I knew right away that I had to apply for this job.</p>
    <p>Litmus is a company that is dedicated to doing things the right way. They are at the forefront of the email marketing world, ahead of the curve on accessibility and analytics.</p>
    <p>From my perspective, it's clear that email marketing is going to go through <a href="http://arstechnica.com/information-technology/2013/12/gmail-blows-up-e-mail-marketing-by-caching-all-images-on-google-servers/" target="_blank">some</a> <a href="https://litmus.com/blog/mobile-opens-hit-record-high-of-47" target="_blank">drastic</a> <a href="http://blog.mailchimp.com/how-gmail-tabs-affect-your-email-marketing-an-update/" target="_blank">changes</a> over the coming years. Working for a company that is ready for this challenge sounds like an amazing opportunity.</p>
    
    <h2>How I think I can help</h2>
    <p>In the recent past I've:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>Helped a client setup an <a href="http://heartcenteredandprofitable.com/" target="_blank">email auto-responder</a> (I used Aweber, sorry!)</li>
      <li>Co-wrote a <a href="http://peterharriscreative.com/" target="_blank">marketing handbook</a> used for lead generation (I used Mailchimp, sorry again!)</li>
      <li>Received my MBA from <a href="http://www.antiochne.edu/mba-sustainability/" target="_blank">Antioch University New England</a></li>
      <li>Developed a <a href="http://launch.brand-essentials.com/" target="_blank">promotional video</a> for a new company</li>
      <li>Learned face-to-face customer service skills while working in restaurants through college and graduate school</li>
      <li>Started a blog on my <a href="http://gregelizondo.github.io">Ruby learning journey</a></li>
    </ul>
    <p>Throughout all of my professional experiences, one thing has remained a constant: customers love getting wow'ed! Regardless of the industry I have worked in, I can proudly say that my customer's experiences have come first.</p>
    <p>I take the words of Zig Ziglar to heart: "You can have everything in life you want, if you will just help enough other people get what they want."</p>
    <p>One of my previous employers had this to say about me:</p>
    <blockquote><em>Greg kicks ass. He possesses a fantastic balance of creativity and business savvy that can be employed across a range of work. He worked tirelessly in nearly a year with me I never heard him complain... He is a fantastic communicator equally adept at listening as sharing ideas. And he can juggle projects like nobody making long, hectic days much more bearable.</em><br/>
    &mdash; Heath Korvola</blockquote>
    <p><strong>tl;dr</strong> I'm a tech-savvy MBA that dabbles with code and learned the importance of wow'ing customers at a young age. I believe I would excel at this position and help Litmus grow.</p>
  
    <h2>Why I want to work for Litmus</h2>
    <p>Litmus strikes me as a <em>truly</em> unique organization.</p>
    <p>The thought of working with a team that has a high level of cohesiveness sounds like a dream come true. Along with that, the progressive nature of the software industry (SaaS in particular) makes me jump for joy inside. Litmus seems like an organization committed to non-stop learning and opportunity. I plan on working within the software industry for a long time and this seems like a golden opportunity.</p>
    
    <h2>Contact</h2>
    <p>I look forward to hearing from you! If you have any questions, please don't hesitate to reach out.</p>
