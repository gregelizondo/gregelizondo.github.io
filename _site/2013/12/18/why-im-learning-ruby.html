				<h1>Why I'm Learning Ruby</h1>

<div class="content">
	<div class="post"><p>For the last couple years, I&#39;ve been dabbling with learning <a href="http://www.ruby-lang.org">Ruby</a> and <a href="http://rubyonrails.org/">Rails</a>. For the most part, the process has pretty much looked the same: I&#39;d devote hours to reading and watching with not enough time spent actually coding. I would start some projects but always felt like I just didn&#39;t &quot;get it.&quot; Eventually, I would encounter a problem or a bug I couldn&#39;t fix and would give up in frustration.</p>

<p>I would like to avoid this frustrating carousel of disappointment this time around.</p>

<p>Nearly all of the advice I&#39;ve read online has said that teaching is the best way to truly learn a subject. So, this blog is my attempt at learning how to become a proficient web developer by teaching what I learn.</p>

<h2>Why?</h2>

<p>I like solving problems. From what I understand, this is the majority of what programmers get to do during the day AND they get paid for it. I understand it isn&#39;t all rainbows and glitter but it sounds like an interesting and challenging way to make a living.</p>

<p>I&#39;m pretty happy with what I do now (I work in Marketing for a small creative firm) but I&#39;ve wanted to work on web applications for years.</p>

<p>I love the web. I love the power it has to connect and automate.</p>

<p>My goal is to self-teach my way towards a Junior Ruby Developer position.</p>

<h2>Materials</h2>

<p>This is not an exhaustive list but these are some of the resources I&#39;ll be using:</p>

<ul>
<li><a href="http://pragmaticstudio.com/ruby/">Ruby Programming</a> video course by The Pragmatic Studio</li>
<li><a href="http://www.amazon.com/Agile-Development-Rails-Facets-Ruby/dp/1937785564/">Agile Web Development with Rails 4</a> by Sam Ruby, Dave Thomas, and David Heinemeier Hansson</li>
<li><a href="http://railscasts.com/">Rails Casts</a> by Ryan Bates</li>
</ul>

<h2>Suggestions?</h2>

<p>If you&#39;ve gone down a similar learning path and have any suggestions, I&#39;m all ears. You can find me on Twitter at <a href="https://twitter.com/gregelizondo">@gregelizondo</a>.</p>
