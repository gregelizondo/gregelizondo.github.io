  <p>Hi Help Scout,</p>
  <p>My name is Greg. I'm a Marketing Associate with an MBA. I recently saw your post for the Platform Builder position on WeWorkRemotely.com and knew instantly that I had to apply. Here are...</p>
  <h1>5 reasons why I'd be a great Platform Builder:</h1>
</header>
<main>
<article class="post">
  
  <h2>#1: I'm a sponge for information.</h2>
  <p>With  the constant changes happening in online marketing, it's imperative that marketers stay up-to-date on what's working and what's not. In my opinion, some of the best SaaS content creators out there are <a href="https://litmus.com/blog/" target="_blank">Litmus</a>, <a href="http://wistia.com/blog" target="_blank">Wistia</a>, <a href="http://blog.kissmetrics.com/" target="_blank">KISSmetrics</a>, and <a href="http://blog.bufferapp.com/" target="_blank">Buffer</a>. Along with a host of marketing, business, and self-improvement books, I regularly read their content.</p>
  
  <h2>#2: I've built audiences and learned from my failures.</h2>
  <p>I'm the co-founder a SaaS called <a href="http://www.gethourglass.com/" target="_blank">Hourglass</a>. Although it's starting to look like we might have missed the mark on our product/market fit, the lessons I've learned are invaluable. We have a consistent supply of new email subscribers every month that come in via our blog and freebies.</p>
  
  <p>I'm also in the process of developing my first educational product that teaches GRE-level math. I've been able to:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>capture the #1 spot on YouTube for the search term <a href="https://www.youtube.com/results?search_query=gre+math" target="_blank">"GRE math"</a> and drive daily email subscribers.</li>
    <li>sell more than <a href="images/gr-gml.png">$1,000</a> worth of pre-sales.</li>
    <li>track analytics and tighten up my conversion funnel.</li>
    <li>leverage relationships within the GRE education community via Facebook and forums.</li>
    <li>provide great customer service and gather testimonials.</li>
  </ul>
    <p>My long-term plan is finish this product, then leverage my experience into building a personal brand. Although not all of my efforts have been successful, I think I know when to double down.</p>
    
  <h2>#3: I'm not afraid to reach out and build relationships.</h2>
  <p>I've reached out to some of my business heroes like Jason Fried, Ruben Gamez, Brennan Dunn, and Noah Kagan for actionable advice. In each case, they've given me words of wisdom that I took action on. I followed up with them and let them know how much they helped me. I think I can put these networking skills into overdrive with the backing of Help Scout.</p>
  
  <h2>#4: I'm tech savvy and learn quickly.</h2>
  <p>In the past year I've designed logos in Illustrator, laid out print catalogs in InDesign, <a href="http://www.brandfundamentals.net/" target="_blank">produced videos</a> with ScreenFlow, and developed websites in WordPress. Although marketing is my true passion, technology and software are close behind. I'd relish the chance to start creating video and written content for a great company like Help Scout.</p>
  <p>With the access to information that an internet connection grants you, I don't think there's any excuse to not always be learning something new. With enough hustle and motivation, I believe it's possible to teach yourself almost anything.</p>
  
  <h2>#5: People seem to like working with me.</h2>
  <p>A former professor and a current Regional Director with the <a href="http://www.nhsbdc.org/" target="_blank">NHSBDC</a> had this to say about me:</p>
  <blockquote>I am in a unique position of having worked with Greg while at Antioch and in his current position, and of his suite of impressive skills, I am most impressed with his ability to continually adapt to market conditions and the needs of his clients. Being a marketing professional today is not easy - one can no longer rely on "tried and true" methods, and Greg continues to embrace innovative approaches, especially those that build from technology platforms.</blockquote>
  
  <p>In addition to that, my current boss wrote about me:</p>
  <blockquote>Smart. Industrious. Innovative. Greg is pleasant to work with. He has well defined ideas and communicates them effectively. He has diverse interests and capabilities, which make him a tremendous asset in a small office. Greg is a great listener and a true collaborator.</blockquote>
